History Quizz App

 Overview
The History Quiz App is an educational Android application designed to help users test their knowledge on key historical topics using a flashcard-style True/False quiz format. 
The current version of the app focuses on The Cold War, one of the key topics in the South African Grade 12 History curriculum.
The app provides immediate feedback on answers, tracks user performance, and allows review of all correct answers at the end of the quiz.

Features
 Welcome Screen – Introduces the app and allows users to enter their name and start the quiz.

 Flashcard Question Screen – Displays one True/False question at a time with radio button options.

 Score Screen – Shows the user’s score out of 5 and provides motivational feedback based on their performance.

 Review Screen – Lists all five questions along with the correct answers to support learning and review.

 Smooth navigation between all screens.

 Instant feedback after each answer to reinforce learning.

 Responsive and clean UI design for an optimal mobile experience.

 Purpose of the App
The purpose of this app is to provide a simple and interactive way for users—especially high school students—to reinforce their knowledge of The Cold War.
The flashcard format promotes active recall, which is proven to enhance learning retention.
This app serves as a revision tool, helping students prepare for assessments while receiving immediate, constructive feedback.

 Design Considerations
The app follows a modular screen-based design using multiple activities (Welcome, Quiz, Score, and Review).

The UI was designed for clarity and ease of use, using large text, button-based navigation, and feedback elements that enhance interactivity.

Radio buttons were chosen for answer selection to ensure only one option is chosen per question, avoiding confusion.

A consistent color scheme and spacing make the app visually appealing and accessible.

 GitHub & GitHub Actions
 GitHub
The project was version-controlled using GitHub, where all code changes were:

Pushed regularly with clear commit messages.

Stored publicly for easy access, collaboration, and tracking of development progress.

 GitHub Actions
To ensure build stability and code quality:

GitHub Actions was configured using an automated workflow.

The workflow runs checks to build the project on every push to the repository.

This helps verify that the codebase is always deployable across different environments.
